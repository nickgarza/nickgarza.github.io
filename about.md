Hello!
I am a graduate of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, with majors in computer science and biomedical engineering. Recently, I've loved getting experience developing software for industry that can have large impact. My interests lie in the fields of software engineering, design, and human-computer interaction and I'm currently pursuing coursework to grow in these areas. This year I'm excited to join the Cloud + AI team at Microsoft as a software engineer.
