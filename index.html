Welcome to my GitHub!  
I am a current 3rd year student studying at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, with majors in biomedical engineering 
and computer science. My past experience has largely been in the computational biology field, working with genomic data
and finding trends and indicators for cancer as well as cardiovascular disease. I hope to gain even more experience 
in the future with courses like machine learning and natural language processing to develop applications. This space will serve mostly as my workspace for informal/independent projects that have no conflict with my university allowing me to share
source code.

A few private projects not listed on this page include:  
1. Rudimentary Photoshop: written in ANSI C without use of APIs or such.  
The photoshop-esqe tool allowed for grayscale, cropping, saturation, and channel swapping of the input photo.

2. Chess: written in C++ without the use of APIs or such.  
The C++ chess game simulated a full game of chess until either a stalemate or checkmate was reached. Additionally, the chess game allowed the saving of a current game and the loading of previous matches.

3. Quorum Sensing Simulator: written in Python under assumptions of Hill Equation.  
From Wikipedia:  
"In biology, quorum sensing is the ability to detect and to respond to cell population density by gene regulation. As one example, quorum sensing (QS) enables bacteria to restrict the expression of specific genes to the high cell densities at which the resulting phenotypes will be most beneficial. Many species of bacteria use quorum sensing to coordinate gene expression according to the density of their local population. In similar fashion, some social insects use quorum sensing to determine where to nest."
Our project was to create a model for a biological quorum sensing system. Essentially a "bacterium" will produce a protein (P) which produces an autoinducer(AI) which then feeds back and causes more of itself to be produced. We used the Hill equation to simulate this production and added necessary parameters to simulate responses over time (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_equation_(biochemistry)).
Within the realm of computing, quorom sensing has important relevance to feedback control in general for decision making within a decentralized system.
Our sample data to fit is included in this folder as a .csv file and running the .py script should generate plots of our model superimposed with the expected values.

The code for these projects are not allowed to be publicly available as they were crucial projects in courses within the CS and BME departments at JHU, but can be shared upon request through reaching me at my email: ngarza@jhu.edu
